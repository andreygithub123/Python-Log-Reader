# Python-Log-Reader

## Introduction
`Python-Log-Reader` is a Python library designed to parse and analyze log files, focusing on identifying API usage metrics, error rates, and operational insights. It takes log entries as input, extracts valuable data regarding API calls, including their success rates, errors, and execution times, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the underlying system's performance.

## Features
- **Log Parsing:** Efficient parsing of log files with support for multiple log formats.
- **API Usage Analysis:** Detailed insights into how frequently APIs are called, their success/failure rates, and performance metrics.
- **Error Tracking:** Identification and summarization of error logs for quick troubleshooting.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculation of execution times and identification of bottlenecks.
- **Report Generation:** Generation of summary reports in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) for further analysis.

## Installation
This library is available on PyPI, making it easy to install using pip. Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system, then run the following command:

```shell
pip install python-log-reader

Usage
To use Python-Log-Reader, import the library into your Python script and pass the log file path to the appropriate function. Here's a simple example:

from python_log_reader import LogReader

# Initialize the log reader with your log file path
log_reader = LogReader('/path/to/your/logfile.log')

# Analyze the log file and print the summary
summary = log_reader.analyze()
print(summary)
